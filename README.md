# This project was made not to solve a problem but to help my understanding of C; understanding Structs: user input, printing struct content into files... and git and Github

# Concepts learnt: Structs, malloc, basic security/vulnerabilities (Excel command injections)

# Stack: 
- Clion as an ide, preffered choice for multiple reasons (refactor tools, debbuging, ready boilerplate, abstracted git commands)
- git for version control
- C

# Key features:
To help keep the main code clean, I used the "test.c" file to test features and snippets of code
And making the "extrens.h" to hold the struct and functions as they became very complex and long

# Points of improvement:
- Adding a feature where the user can name the file as they please
// didn't add it since this was a project mainly for learning structs ;p
